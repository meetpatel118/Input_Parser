# Input_Parser
 

The code has developed in Google colab.

To execute the code, upload the Input_File_Parser.ipynb file to the Colab or Jupyter Notebook alog with other required files like error_codes.json, standard_defition.json, and input_file.txt and execute the code.

To execute the code in different environment like VS Code, need to use input_file_parser.py and provide the file path instead of only file name.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The updated changes contains input_file_parser.py file. 
   To execute the code use command prompt. It will ask required files. Provide full path of the files.
   
   The unit test is written in the unit_test.py file. Fllow the same process to execute unit_test file.
   It will also ask for the file names. Provide full path of the files.
   
2) In the folder Input_Parser_Unittest, I have provided additional test case to test the code.
   Use input_test_case.txt as input file name to test additional test cases.
   
   unit_test_case.py contain code to test each function using additional test case.
   This code will aslo be executed from ommand prompt and by providing required full path of files.
